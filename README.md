# [Module](https://github.com/Start-Out/golden-paths/wiki/Concepts#module): Express

![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Start-Out-blue)

A boilerplate/starter project that's barely one step above prototyping with `index.html` alone.

# Quick Start

> ## NOTE: HTTPS
> The default configuration expects CA Certificates (`./src/out/localhost.key` and `./src/out/localhost.crt`). If you just need
> an unsecured connection, see the end of `./src/index.js` and comment out the `https.createServer()` in favor of `app.listen()`.

# Run your tiny server

A couple of run scripts are included

```bash
npm start
```

```bash
npm run dev
```
