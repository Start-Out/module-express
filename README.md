![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Start-Out-blue)

A boilerplate/starter project that's barely one step above prototyping with `index.html` alone.

# Quick Start

# Run your tiny server

A couple of run scripts are included

```bash
npm start
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

> [!NOTE]
> ### HTTPS
> The default configuration is unsecured. If you need a secured connection, see end of `index.js` which expects CA Certificates (`./src/out/localhost.key` and `./src/out/localhost.crt`).
